# <center> 2shine a skin to make Dnn websites beautiful  </center> 

---
This theme is a layout/skin for the CMS [DNN](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform) based on [Bootstrap5](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). It allows you to create simple custom designs within minutes and complex designs within a few hours. This is why it's called *instant*.

If you are not familiar with Dnn you should be starting there. You will get the most out of 2shine in combination with a proffessional bootstrap content-template like [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases).

2shine is an open-source software which was designed and developed by professionals at **[2sic](https://www.2sic.com/)** in Switzerland. 2shine is build on Bootstrap 5 and implements all the newest technologies and best practices. 

Any given paths in this documentation will always take the 2shine root folder as starting point.
